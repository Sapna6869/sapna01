		<p style="font-family: Ariel;text-align:justify; text-size:10px">Formal education is a structured and systematic form of learning. This is the education of a certain standard delivered to students by trained teachers. To make sure formal learning is standardized and all learning institutions (e.g. schools, colleges, universities, etc.) comply with these standards, formal education in a country is governed by organizations.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Ariel;text-align:justify;text-size:10px">Formal education is classroom-based, meaning everything a student learns comes books and other educational materials with the sole purpose of educating students. All teachers are trained and licensed to teach children, and theyâ€™re the same teachers the students will see every day to keep their education and training consistent.</p></h2>

		<p style="font-family: Ariel;text-align:justify;text-size:10px">Informal education is a general term for education that can occur outside of a structured curriculum. Informal education encompasses student interests within a curriculum in a regular classroom, but is not limited to that setting. It works through conversation, and the exploration and enlargement of experience. Sometimes there is a clear objective link to some broader plan, but not always. The goal is to provide learners with the tools he or she needs to eventually reach more complex material.It can refer to various forms of alternative education, such as unschooling or homeschooling, autodidacticism (self-teaching), and youth work.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Ariel;text-align:justify;text-size:10px">Informal education consists of an accidental and purposeful ways of collaborating on new information. It can be discussion based and focuses on bridging the gaps between traditional classroom settings and life outside of the classroom.</p>
