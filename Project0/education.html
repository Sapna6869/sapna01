       <center><h3>Importance of Education in our Life.</h3> </center>
        <br>

        <p> Education plays a very important role in our life. It is necessary that people gain education and put it into effect. It is not important only for good earning and status of life but manners and thinking are also affected by education. So, educated also brings a sense of responsibility in people.</p>
        
        <p>The impacts of education on our daily living cannot be overemphasized. Education is light; it is bringing you into the understanding of things that look like darkness to you. The truth is that all we have become is due to the fact that we interacted with a body of knowledge at a point in our lives, and that changes our perspective about many things of life.</p>

        <p>Aside from the fact that education is needed for personal and social development, it is also needed for economic development. When you are educated about something, it places values on you, and you become a commodity that people are ready to buy at any cost. The world has witnessed a considerable level of development just because people are constantly visualizing things that can be made real. Education won't make you live your life as a mediocre, because you are constantly being informed about things as they are unfolding.</p><br>

        <p>There are many things that people need in life, and education is just one of them. Education is important not only because it teaches people many things. It also teaches people a lot of virtues and values that they would use in the long run. For example, going to school teaches students to become responsible at an early age because they have to follow the right time to go to school.</p>

        <p>They need to do assignments, and so much more. These things may seem easy to do, but these will help people know how to become more disciplined. They can act according to how society expects them to. At the same time, they are also given more opportunities in order to have a better life in the long run.</p>
